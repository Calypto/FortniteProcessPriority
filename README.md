# FortniteProcessPriority

These registry fixes will allow you to change Fortnite's process priority, and permanently. I made these .reg files because the EasyAntiCheat wouldn't let me change my priority, and to make it easier to share them with others.

For streamers, I recommend using the High Priority file and setting your streaming program's priority to Above Normal. For everyone else, use High Priority. To revert to normal, use the Normal file.
