# FortniteProcessPriority

These registry fixes allow you to change Fortnite's process priority, and permanently. I made these .reg files because EasyAntiCheat wouldn't let me change my priority, and to make it easier to share with others.

For streamers, I recommend using the High Priority file and setting your streaming program's priority to Above Normal. For everyone else, use the High Priority file in case something else is running at above normal priority. To revert to normal, use the Normal file.
