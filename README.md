# FortniteProcessPriority

These registry entries allow you to set Fortnite's process priority permanently. I made these .reg files because EasyAntiCheat wouldn't let me change my priority. This is better because now I don't have to use Task Manager every time.

For streamers, I recommend using the High Priority file and setting your streaming program's priority to Above Normal. For everyone else, use the High Priority file in case something else is running at above normal priority. To revert to normal, use the Normal file.


Installation instructions:
Click "Clone or Download" (the green button), extract the file you need and double click it.
